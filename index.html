		<p>Welcome to Jazzz, the website for all of your jazz inquiries. If you&#39;re new to jazz, then you&#39;ve come to the perfect place. Throughout this website, you&#39;ll have everything you need to know about jazz to continue your swinging journey.<p>
		<p>First things first, you need to have a role model, not to have someone to look up to but to follow in their footsteps and to try to be just as good or maybe even better. Seeing as you&#39;re on this website, you should already have an instrument, whether it&#39;s trombone, trumpet, saxophone, drums, piano, clarinet, oboe, violin or even flute, it doesn&#39;t matter what instrument you play, as long as you play in the right style.</p>
		<p>If you’re a trumpet player I would recommend&#58;</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Wynton Marsalis</li>
			  <li>Louis Armstrong</li>
			  <li>Miles Davis</li>
			</ul>
		<p>If you’re a trombone player I would recommend&#58;</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>J. J. Johnson</li>
			  <li>Wycliffe Gordon</li>
			  <li>Curtis Fuller</li>
			</ul>
		<p>If you’re a sax player of any kind, I would recommend&#58;</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Victor Goines</li>
			  <li>Bob Wilber</li>
			  <li>Charlie Parker</li>
			</ul>
		<p>All of these are incredibly easy to find. I myself am a trombonist and I personally look up to Wycliffe Gordon. All you have to do is just find someone who fits your style and learn from how they play. You don&#39;t have to play any special instrument, like I said before, any instrument can be a jazz instrument as long as you play in the right style. Obviously, that sounds super corny but look up the Sachal jazz ensemble and I swear your mind will be blown.</p>
		<p>Here are some websites that have tons of music and scores so you can start getting into playing jazz music&#58;</p>
